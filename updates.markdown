### Assessment 1 is Complete
> 12.11.2019

This has been a long week with lots of reading, rereading and even more reading... But we feel confident with the doucmentation we submitted and we even have some time to spare. We are now straight into the second assessment with some actual game development which will be fun. We will be posting an update when we have some new information 


### GitHub Pages is up! ðŸ™Œ
> 06.11.2019

Finally set up the pages for our project! Here we will include all documentaion, assessment folders and game download. This is the first update, we have started the project requirements, architecture, methods, and risks. This is all for our "assessment 1" of SEPR and so far so good!
